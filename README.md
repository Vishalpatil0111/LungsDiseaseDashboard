# ü´Å Lung Disease Prediction Dashboard

This project is a full-stack AI-powered application that predicts the risk of pulmonary (lung) diseases based on lifestyle, environmental, and physiological inputs. It includes a **React frontend**, **Flask backend**, and a **Random Forest model** with calibrated probability outputs and SHAP explainability.

---

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ **AI Risk Prediction** using a trained and calibrated Random Forest model.
* üìà **SHAP Explainability** to visualize how each input feature influences predictions.
* üìä **Interactive Dashboard** displaying:

  * Risk Level (Low, Medium, High)
  * SHAP Feature Importance Chart
  * Oxygen level trend chart (if applicable)
  * Educational graphics and animated content
* üì± **Fully Responsive UI** with animations (GSAP) for enhanced user engagement.
* üîí **Backend Integration** with Flask serving prediction results and SHAP values.
